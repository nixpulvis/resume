    {\emph{Aug. 2019 -- Aug. 2020}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Collaberativly developed a hybrid-mode secure programming language
    design for multi-party computation (MPC)
    \item Represented my team, at both remote and in-person technical exchange
    meetings with other researchers
    \item Built a prototype implementation of our language, which is forked
    from the Rust programming language
    \item Began a formalism for our language(s), which will include sound
    typing rules, and reductions

    \item Conducted mini lectures, monitored class progress, and answered
    students' questions
    \item Discovered new ways to present concepts that facilitated student
    understanding
    \item Assisted students during established office hours

    {\emph{Sr. Software Engineer}}
    {\emph{May 2018 -- Aug. 2019}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Developed a client wrapper for an Algolia search implementation
    \item Performed various application performance improvements, often caused
    by unacceptable response times, quickly
    \item Planned architecture refactoring, including object model
    improvements, and a new data permissions system
    \item Lead efforts to create an orchestration CLI for managing a complex
    Heroku + Salesforce microservice system
    \item Mentored the cooperative university students by providing deep code
    reviews, and spending time pairing on problems

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Built API integrations for the HOMER C\# application, including REST
    and CSV file APIs, which involved a general refactoring of the code which
    imports data, complete with added tests
    \item Developed an internal tool to view the Google Protocol Buffer used to
    pass values between all parts of the application, allowing developers to
    quickly see what the values of program inputs and outputs were
    \item Created a web based front-end for HOMER in Rails, which served at the
    starting point for another version of HOMER, and provided a proof of
    concept for how to integrate the HOMER API with a webserver

    {\emph{Software Engineer}}
    {\emph{Jan. 2015 -- Aug. 2015, Jul. 2016 -- Jul. 2017}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Built a Ruby library (\texttt{radic}) and CLI (\texttt{radish}) for
    interacting with Apple's bug management system (aka Radar)
    \item Took part in a broader internal web design initiative to create
    common components for the hardware teams
    \item Contributed to an internal tool for managing hardware validation,
    which was somewhat inspired by Travis CI
    \item Contributed to another internal tool for analysing large amounts of
    pre-production device test data

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Pushed code to the front-end and back-end for all four of Americas
    Test Kitchen's websites, including bug fixes and technical infrastructure
    upgrades
    \item Built modularized components to abstract functionality found common
    throughout the companies codebase

  \headerrow
    {\emph{Software Developer}}
    {\emph{Jan. 2013 -- June 2013}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item Developed an automated build system, which allowed developers to see
    how their changes would affect a real build of the system, which reduced
    turnaround time, allowing anyone to easily run a build
    \item Addressed user reported issues in Ruby/Rails and LUA, including
    hardening validations and updating database migrations for old versions
    of the software
    \item Designed a class/model structure for users and accesspoints, which
    allowed the back-end to represent clients of individual accesspoints
