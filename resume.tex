    {\emph{Software Developer}}
    {\emph{Jan 2013 -- Jun 2013}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Developed an automated build system which allowed developers to see how their
    changes would affect a real build of the system. Made turnaround time on
    changes faster, and allowed everyone to run a build.
    \item
    Fixed user reported issues in Ruby/Rails and LUA. Including hardening
    validations, and updating database migrations for old versions of the
    software.
    \item
    Designed a class/model structure for users and accesspoints which allowed the
    back-end to represent clients of individual accesspoints.
  \end{itemize*}

    {\emph{Tutor for Fundamentals of Computer Science 1}}
    {\emph{Fall 2012, Fall 2013}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Assisted in labs for the class by monitoring the classes progress, helping
    students with questions, and teaching concepts in new ways.
    \item
    Taught students during office hours about concepts of the course. Provided
    new outlooks on problems and guided students to their own answers.
    \item
    Graded homework, and provided feedback.
  \end{itemize*}

    {\emph{Software Developer, Summer Intern}}
    {\emph{Summer 2012}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Debugged a flex/flash application, cleaning up the UI and fixing issues.
    \item
    Developed an internal tool to view the Google Protocol Buffer used to pass
    values between all parts of the application. This allowed developers to
    quickly see what the values of program inputs and outputs were.
    \item
    Began a web based front-end for HOMER in Rails. This was the starting point
    for the basic edition of HOMER, and provided a proof of concept for how
    to integrate the HOMER API with a webserver.

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Structuring and implementing the C++ classes needed to represent the
    notion of a compiler pass, along with the data unique to each pass.
    \item
    Designed an algorithm for an important pass which optimizes valuable
    register use specific to GPUs. This algorithm moves variable storage into
    common registers across units executing in parallel, when possible.

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    RC electronics, including 3-phase brushless motors, electronic speed
    controllers, and LiPo batteries.
    \item
    Dug deeper into microelectronics circuits, connecting motors, and sensors to
    the self-made control board.
	\item
	Interfaced with registers and hardware interrupts to get needed sensory data from
	the sensors on the control board.
    \item
    Taught myself pieces of 3D rotational math needed to understand and compute
    data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to stabilize the craft.
