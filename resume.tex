    {\emph{Software Engineer}}
    {\emph{Jan. 2015 -- Aug 2015, Sep 2016 -- Current}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Developed a Ruby library (\texttt{radic}) and CLI (\texttt{radish}) for
    interacting with Apple's bug managment system (aka Radar).
    \item
    Worked on an internal tool for managing hardware validation.
    \item
    Contributed to an internal tool for analysing pre-production device test
    data.

    {\emph{Jan. 2014 -- June 2014}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Pushed code to the frontend and backend for all four of Americas Test Kitchen's
    websites. Fixed bugs and upgraded technical infrastructure.
    \item
    Built modularized components to abstract functionality found common throughout
    the companies codebase.

    {\emph{Software Developer}}
    {\emph{Jan. 2013 -- June 2013}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Developed an automated build system which allowed developers to see how their
    changes would affect a real build of the system. Made turnaround time on
    changes faster, and allowed everyone to run a build.
    \item
    Fixed user reported issues in Ruby/Rails and LUA. Including hardening
    validations, and updating database migrations for old versions of the
    software.
    \item
    Designed a class/model structure for users and accesspoints which allowed the
    back-end to represent clients of individual accesspoints.

    {\emph{Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Taught labs for the class by giving mini lectures and monitoring the class progress, helping
    students with questions, and teaching concepts in new ways.
    \item
    Held office hours to further help students with the course.

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Developed an internal tool to view the Google Protocol Buffer used to pass
    values between all parts of the application. This allowed developers to
    quickly see what the values of program inputs and outputs were.
    \item
    Began a web based front-end for HOMER in Rails. This was the starting point
    for the basic edition of HOMER, and provided a proof of concept for how
    to integrate the HOMER API with a webserver.

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Structuring and implementing the C++ classes needed to represent the
    notion of a compiler pass, along with the data unique to each pass.
    \item
    Designed an algorithm for an important pass which optimizes valuable
    register use specific to GPUs. This algorithm moves variable storage into
    common registers across units executing in parallel, when possible.
