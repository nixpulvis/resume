    {\emph{Software Developer}}
    {\emph{Jan 2013 -- Jun 2013}}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Developed an automated build system to allow developers to see how their
    changes would effect a real build of the system. Made turnaround time on
    changes faster, and allowed everyone to run a build.
    \item
    Fixed user reported issues in Ruby/Rails and LUA. Including hardening
    validations, and updating database migrations for old versions of the
    software.
    \item
    Designed a class/model structure for users and accesspoints to allow the
    back-end to represent clients of individual accesspoints.

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Assist in labs for the class by monitoring the classes progress, helping
    students with questions, and teaching concepts in new ways.
    \item
    Teach students during office hours about concepts of the course. Provide a
    new outlook on problems and guide students to their own answers.
    \item
    Grade homework, and provide feedback.

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item
    Debugged a flex/flash application, cleaning up the UI and fixing issues.
    \item
    Developed an internal tool to view the Google Protocol Buffer used to pass
    values between all parts of the application. This allowed developers to
    quickly see what the values of program inputs and outputs were.
    \item
    Began a web based front-end for HOMER in Rails. This was the starting point
    for the starter edition of HOMER, and provided a proof of concept for how
    to integrate the HOMER API with a webserver.
