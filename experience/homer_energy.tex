{\emph{Software Developer, Summer Intern}}
{\emph{Summer 2012, Jul. 2017 - Nov. 2017}}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Built API integrations for the HOMER C\# application, including REST
    and CSV file APIs which involved a general refactoring of the code which
    imports data, complete with added tests
    \item Developed an internal tool to view the Google Protocol Buffer used to
    pass values between all parts of the application allowing developers to
    quickly see inputs and outputs
    \item Created a web-based frontend for HOMER in Rails, which served at the
    starting point for another version and provided a proof of concept for
    how to integrate the HOMER API with a webserver
\end{itemize*}
